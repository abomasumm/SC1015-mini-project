# Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze and predict heart attacks based on various physiological and medical factors. Heart attacks, also known as myocardial infarctions, occur when a part of the heart muscle doesn't receive enough blood, often due to blockages in the coronary arteries.

## Problem Definition
The goal of this project is to apply data science techniques to predict the likelihood of a heart attack based on patient data, thereby potentially saving lives by enabling preventive measures.

## Key Findings from EDA

- **Age Distribution**: The majority of patients experiencing heart attacks were found to be in the age range of 50-60 years. This suggests a higher risk in this age group.

- **Gender Differences**: Males are statistically more likely to experience heart attacks than females, with about 68% of the dataset comprising males who have suffered a heart attack.

- **Cholesterol Levels**: Patients with heart attacks had higher average cholesterol levels compared to the healthy group, indicating a strong correlation between high cholesterol levels and heart attack incidence.

- **Blood Pressure Insights**: High systolic blood pressure was another common factor among heart attack patients, with most patients showing systolic blood pressures above 140 mmHg.

- **Smoking and Heart Attacks**: Smoking status showed a significant correlation with heart attack occurrences. Smokers comprised approximately 30% of heart attack cases, underscoring smoking as a major risk factor.

- **Impact of Exercise**: Patients engaging in regular physical activity were less likely to have a heart attack, highlighting the protective effect of exercise against heart disease.


## What Did We Process in the EDA

- **Missing Values**: Identified and imputed missing values using statistical methods such as median imputation for skewed distributions and mean imputation for normally distributed features.
  
- **Feature Analysis**: Conducted detailed univariate and bivariate analyses, using box plots to visualize distributions and outliers, and bar charts to compare categorical variables.
  
- **Data Normalization**: Standardized numerical features to have zero mean and unit variance, essential for effective model performance.
  
- **Correlation Analysis**: Utilized Pearson correlation coefficients to identify strongly correlated variables, helping to understand the relationships between different risk factors and heart attack incidence.
