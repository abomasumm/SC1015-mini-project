# Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze and predict heart attacks based on various physiological and medical factors. Heart attacks, also known as myocardial infarctions, occur when a part of the heart muscle doesn't receive enough blood, often due to blockages in the coronary arteries.

## Problem Definition
The goal of this project is to apply data science techniques to predict the likelihood of a heart attack based on patient data, thereby potentially saving lives by enabling preventive measures.

## Flow of Pipeline
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Model Building
4. Model Evaluation
5. Conclusion

## Key Findings from EDA
- Identification of key factors influencing heart health.
- Analysis of demographic variability in heart attack incidences.
- Correlations between lifestyle choices and heart attack risks.

## What Did We Process in the EDA
- Handling of missing values.
- Analysis of categorical and numerical features.
- Standardization of data to prepare for modeling.

## Statistical Descriptions
Detailed statistical analysis, including mean, median, mode, and distribution of data sets to understand the trends and underlying patterns in heart health data.

## Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression
- Logistic Regression with Hyperparameter Tuning

## Evaluations of Models
Comparison of model performances based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics to select the most effective model for predicting heart attack likelihood.

## Conclusion
Summary of the insights gained, the effectiveness of different models, and potential areas for further research.

## What We Have Learned
Insights into the complexities of heart health and the role of data science in medical prediction and prevention strategies.
