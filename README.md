# SC1015-mini-project
Hello! We are Group 11 from tutorial group FCED. Our project is about heart disease analysis and prediction. 

Our motivation stems from a pressing need to improve healthcare outcomes by leveraging data-driven approaches. Heart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality globally, accounting for 1/3 of total deaths, or 18,500,000 per year. As the ageing population increases worldwide, this number is expected to increase as well. The ability to predict and prevent life-threatening heart attacks could save countless lives. As such, our project aims to to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify individuals at risk of developing heart disease, enabling early intervention and personalised care.

The dataset we will be using is provided by the University of California, Irvine, from the clinical and noninvasive test results of patients undergoing angiography at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. Their blood vessels were analysed by dyeing their blood and visualising it via X-Ray. It is an openly sourced dataset retrieved from Kaggle.
