# SC1015-mini-project
Hello! We are Group 11 from tutorial group FCED. Our project is about heart disease analysis and prediction. 

Our motivation stems from a pressing need to improve healthcare outcomes by leveraging data-driven approaches. Heart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality globally, accounting for 1/3 of total deaths, or 18,500,000 per year. As the ageing population increases worldwide, this number is expected to increase as well. The ability to predict and prevent life-threatening heart attacks could save countless lives. As such, our project aims to to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify individuals at risk of developing heart disease, enabling early intervention and personalised care.

The dataset we will be using is provided by the University of California, Irvine, from the clinical and noninvasive test results of patients undergoing angiography at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. Their blood vessels were analysed by dyeing their blood and visualising it via X-Ray. It is an openly sourced dataset retrieved from Kaggle.



# Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze and predict heart attacks based on various physiological and medical factors. Heart attacks, also known as myocardial infarctions, occur when a part of the heart muscle doesn't receive enough blood, often due to blockages in the coronary arteries.

## Problem Definition
The goal of this project is to apply data science techniques to predict the likelihood of a heart attack based on patient data, thereby potentially saving lives by enabling preventive measures.

## Flow of Pipeline
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Model Building
4. Model Evaluation
5. Conclusion

## Key Findings from EDA
- Identification of key factors influencing heart health.
- Analysis of demographic variability in heart attack incidences.
- Correlations between lifestyle choices and heart attack risks.

## What Did We Process in the EDA
- Handling of missing values.
- Analysis of categorical and numerical features.
- Standardization of data to prepare for modeling.

## Statistical Descriptions
Detailed statistical analysis, including mean, median, mode, and distribution of data sets to understand the trends and underlying patterns in heart health data.

## Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression
- Logistic Regression with Hyperparameter Tuning

## Evaluations of Models
Comparison of model performances based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics to select the most effective model for predicting heart attack likelihood.

## Conclusion
Summary of the insights gained, the effectiveness of different models, and potential areas for further research.

## What We Have Learned
Insights into the complexities of heart health and the role of data science in medical prediction and prevention strategies.
